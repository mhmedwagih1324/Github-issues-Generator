# Github-issues-Generator

This project should help create issues for you from a finished planning markdown file in one command.

## Idea

When planning for a new feature or solving a bug you might always make a markdown file listing all the tasks but need to create an issue for each task that can be assigned to someone, the process of creating that issues becomes time consuming when the feature or the bug is complicated.
